## About the project ðŸš€
#The "CollegeGo" mobile application built using Xamarin.Forms is designed to cater to the needs of a college environment, facilitating interactions between students, teachers, and heads of departments (HODs). Here's a brief explanation of the project:
Tabbed Pages Structure: The app comprises four main tabbed pages: Student Page, Teacher Page, HOD Page, and REST API Page.
SQLite Database Integration: Utilizing SQLite enables the app to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) efficiently, ensuring seamless management of data within the application.
REST API Integration: Besides the local database, the app also interfaces with external REST APIs to perform CRUD operations, enhancing data accessibility and flexibility.
MVVM Pattern Implementation: The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern is employed throughout the application, facilitating separation of concerns and ensuring maintainability and testability.
Student Page: Allows students to view and manage their information, such as name, department, ID, gender, year, state, and teacher-related details.
Teacher Page: Enables teachers to add and display their information in an organized manner, including name, department, gender, year, ID, and HOD-related details.
HOD Page: Provides HODs with functionalities to manage their department effectively, including selecting teachers from a picker (based on existing teachers' data) and potentially mapping students and other administrative tasks.
REST API Page: Facilitates CRUD operations through a user-friendly interface, employing MVVM pattern for efficient data management.

# Additional Features:

Pull-to-Refresh: Allows users to refresh content on all pages easily.
Filter Popup: Provides a convenient way to filter student data based on department.
Swipe View Delete: Enables users to delete entries with a swipe gesture, enhancing user experience.
Mapped Student Lists: Teachers can view lists of mapped students in an aesthetically pleasing design, improving data visualization.
Internet Connectivity Alert: Alerts users in case of no internet connectivity, ensuring seamless operation.
Long Press Popup: Enables users to perform delete and edit actions using a long-press gesture in the REST API Page.
API Integration: Incorporates external APIs to retrieve additional data such as states and strangers' data, enhancing the application's functionality and utility.
